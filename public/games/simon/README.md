When the game is started, colour segments will flash in a sequence. Once they have stopped flahing, click them in this exact sequence. The aim of the game is to achieve a long a sequence as possible.

To start the game, select `Power` and click `Start`. A coloured segment will flash. Once it has stopped, click on this segment. Then two colours will flash in sequence, and once these have been clicked in the correct order, three colours will flash in sequence, ... Once an incorrect colour is clicked, the sequence will start flashing again. If uou cannot remember, restart the game. If `Strict` is enabled, when an incorrect colour is clicked, the game will restart and not give you a chance to try that sequence again.
