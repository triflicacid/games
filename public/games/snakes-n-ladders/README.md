# Snakes 'n' Ladders

Try to be the first player to the final `100` square. Take shortcuts by climbing up ladders, and avoid slippery snakes. Players are represented by discs on the square. When it's your go, press the right or left arrow to advance a random number of moves. When reaching square 100, you will be added to the leaderboard on the left-hand side, and once all players have finished, the winner will be declared.

## Controls

- `ArrowLeft` - if on an even row, advances your disc
