# Chopsticks

Each player has two hands, with a single chopstick in each. Each hand may contain a maximum of **5** chopsticks; if this number is exceeded, the hand will 'die' and be removed from play. The aim of the game is to be the final player alive.


On your go, you may transfer chopsticks between your hands or transfer chopsticks to the next player (ths player will have a read outline).

- To transfer chopsticks between your hands, click on the hand you wich to transfer from, and click on your other hand. **Half** of your chopsticks on hand 1 will be transferred to hand 2.

- To transfer chopsticks to the next player, click on your hand you wich to remove chopsticks from, and click the next player's hand (outlined in red). **All** of the chopsticks in your hand will be transferred to their hand. If the number of chopsticks in their hand exceeds **5**, their hand will die and turn red.
