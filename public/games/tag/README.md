# Tag

A basic two-player tag game. One player controls the target, the other controls the crosshair. Initially, player 1 starts as the target and player 2 as the crosshair. The crosshair chases the target. If it shoots the target, it gains a point (or a fraction of a point, depending on which strata they hit) and control switches. The aim of the game is to have the greatest score. Note that there is a brief cooldown between shots.
