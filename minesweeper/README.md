# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a game about avoiding mines. When the game is started, a grid is generated. Behind each cell there is a chance of being a bomb, with the aim being to reveal every cell which doesn't have a bomb behind it in order to win.

If a cell doesn't contain a bomb, it will contain a number (or be empty). This tells you how many bombs are adjacent to that cell. This can be used in conjunction with other numbers to determine where bombs are or are not.

## Controls

- Left-mouse click on a cell to reveal it
- Right-mouse click on a cell to flag/unflag it (when a cell is flagged, it cannot be revealed)
