# Snake

You control a snake made up of segments, and use the arrows to control its direction of movement. The aim of the game is to become as long as possible; the snake grows by one segment by eating the food (red dots). The snake dies if it either touches the sides or touches itself. The score is kept track of on the right hand side and, once it advances past 30, the snake becomes rainbow coloured (yay).
