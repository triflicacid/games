# Ludo

Game of Ludo. The aim of the gane is to move all of your pieces into your `landing strip`.

When it is your go, click on the `Roll` button to roll the die.

Spawn a piece in by clicking on your spawning area. A piece will spawn if you have a double-number on your die, or you have gone three goes with no pieces on the board.

You may move one of your pieces by a digit shown on a die. You can only move a piece by the exact digit shown. Move your piece into the same position as an enemy piece to take it. You cannot take your own piece.

Move your pieces around the board and advance onto your landing stip (colored in a lighter shade of your team color). Get all of your pieces onto this strip to win.
