# Games

This repository holds (small) games that I have created.

Some games required the use of a web server, some do not

- If a webserver is required:
    - Download `npm`, run `npm install http-server` and run `http-server` in the console
    - Download python, and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`. If it is not installed, run `pip install SimpleHTTPServer` and try again.
    - Launch chrome, go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb and download. Choose `games/` as the folder, and click the link (like `http://127.0.0.1:[port]`) to launch.
- Else, you can double-click the `index.html` file and start playing!
